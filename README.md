- Quarterbacks (QBs) vs. Defenses
- Running Backs (RBs) vs. Defenses
- Wide Receivers (WRs) vs. Defenses
- Overall Offensive Units vs. Defenses

## Project Structure

  **scripts/passing_scripts**: Contains filter for passing plays only for the scripts. 
  - `qb_vs_defense.py`: Analyzes QBs' performance against different defenses.
  - `rb_vs_defense.py`: Analyzes RBs' performance against different defenses. - PLACEHOLDER 
  - `defence_vs_offensive_formation.py`: Analyzes overall defensive performance against different offensive formations.
  - `wr_vs_defense.py`: Analyzes WRs' performance against different defenses.
  - `offense_vs_defense.py`: Analyzes overall offensive performance against different defenses.
